  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of Focus Drift Detection application. Backend APIs are fully functional (18/18 tests passed). Frontend UI loads correctly with all required elements and data-testid attributes. Real-time tracking works for all metrics including scroll events (with proper debouncing), clicks, mouse movements, and idle time detection. Drift analysis algorithm correctly identifies patterns and provides recommendations. Navigation between landing page and dashboard works seamlessly. Start/stop tracking functionality operates correctly. MongoDB data persistence is working. Application is production-ready.",
